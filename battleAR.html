            BattleAR is an Augmented Reality game played through a smart phone. The game is to be played on a relatively flat surface in the real world. The goal of the game is to destroy the enemy's Command Center with aid of computer controlled players to win. Two teams of computer controlled players (one red and the other blue) initially spawn at each team's respective Command Centers at the start of the game. Then, the player chooses from a selection of firearms before joining a team to fight for. If a player dies in combat, then the player respawns after a specified delay back at the player's Command Center.

            This was a solo project where I did all of the work ranging from art, programming and games design. The soldiers were 3D modelled, rigged, and animated in Maya; the textures were hand painted in Photoshop. UI element sprites such as the menu buttons were designed in Illustrator. Gameplay was programmed through Unity's C# scripting language and a little shader code (mostly for the team colors and cutout shader). The entire game was made in Unity 3D. Google's ARCore plugin for Unity was used to allow the game to easily find and track flat surfaces in the real world.
